# If your Django app is behind a proxy that sets a header to specify secure
# connections, AND that proxy ensures that user-submitted headers with the
# same name are ignored (so that people can't spoof it), set this value to
# a tuple of (header_name, header_value). For any requests that come in with
# that header/value, request.is_secure() will return True.
# WARNING! Only set this if you fully understand what you're doing. Otherwise,
# you may be opening yourself up to a security risk.
