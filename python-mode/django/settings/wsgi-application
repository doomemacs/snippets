# The Python dotted path to the WSGI application that Django's internal server
# (runserver) will use. If `None`, the return value of
# 'django.core.wsgi.get_wsgi_application' is used, thus preserving the same
# behavior as previous versions of Django. Otherwise this should point to an
# actual WSGI application object.
